/// Summary:
/// DataSource is a trait that defines the interface for reading data into the query engine.
/// Any data source (CSV files, Parquet files, in-memory data, etc.) implements this trait
/// allowing the rest of the engine to read data without caring about the underlying storage format.
///
/// schema() acquires the schema from the data source - the column names and their types.
/// The schema serves two purposes:
/// 1. At planning time, it is consulted before any data is read to validate column references,
///    type check expressions, and decide which columns to request in the projection.
/// 2. At execution time, it is packaged into each RecordBatch alongside the actual data
///    so that anything downstream in the query engine knows what the columns mean.
///
/// scan() opens the data source and returns an iterator of RecordBatches.
/// Each RecordBatch contains a slice of rows from the file paired with schema,
/// and is the fundamental unit of data that flows through the query engine for processing.
/// The projection parameter narrows which columns are returned, so the engine never reads more data than it actually needs.
///
/// A trait defines a shared interface that different types can implement.
/// It describes what a type can do without specifying how.
/// It is a shared interface that different types can implement using dynamic dispatch, meaning the concrete type is
/// resolved at runtime rather than compile time.
///
/// DataSource is a trait defining the interface for reading data into the query engine.
/// Any data source (CSV files, Parquet files, in-memory, etc.) implements this trait,
/// allowing the rest of the engine to read data without caring about the underlying storage format.
pub trait DataSource {
    /// Returns the schema of the underlying data source.
    /// Called during query planning so the engine knows what columns and types are available.
    /// The query engine needs the schema before it touches any data.
    /// During query planning, it uses the schema to validate column references, determine output types for expressions and
    /// decide which columns to request in the projection.
    /// Without the schema, the engine is flying blind.
    fn schema(&self) -> Schema;
    /// Scans the data source, returning only the columns specified by name.
    /// Projection pushdown - only reading the columns we actually need - is a key
    /// optimization, especially for wider tables or column formats like Parquet.
    /// Returns an iterator of RecordBatches rather than all data at once, enabling
    /// streaming so the engine never has to hold the entire dataset in memory.
    /// Box<dyn Iterator<Item = RecordBatch>> means any type that implements the Iterator trait and yields RecordBatch values.
    /// We will have different types of iterators (CSV, Parquet, in-memory).
    /// Each one will return a different concrete iterator type, so the trait can't commit to any single one at compile time.
    /// Our return type is the only way to express "I don't know which iterator this will be at runtime, but I guarantee it yields RecordBatch."
    fn scan(&self, projection: Vec<String>) -> Box<dyn Iterator<Item = RecordBatch>>;
    // We are using Box because it gives the caller sole ownership of the iterator without needing to know its concrete type at compile time.
    // Since every data source (CSV, Parquet, in-memory) will return a different iterator struct, we need the indirection to return them all under a single trait object.
    // In other words, we use Box because the compiler needs a fixed-size pointer to put on the stack and dyn Iterator alone has no known size at compile time.
}

// The DataSource trait defines 2 methods: schema() and scan().
// schema() returns the structure of the data - the column names and their types.
// scan() resolves the final schema based on the projection, builds a reader to access the raw data,
// and handes both off to a stateful iterator.
// The iterator is the engine of the data source - each call to next() reads the next batch of raw data, converts
// the columns into ArrowFieldVectors, pairs them with the schema, and returns a RecordBatch.
// This continues until the data is exhausted and next() returns None.
