/// Summary:
/// ParquetDataSource implements the DataSource trait for reading Parquet files.
/// It holds the filename and batch size. Unlike CsvDataSource, no schema or headers flags is needed
/// because Parquet files are self-describing - the schema is always embedded in the file footer.
/// schema() opens the file, reads the footer, and converts the Parquet physical types into our own Schema type.
/// scan() opens the file, maps projection column names to indices, builds ProjectionMask to push
/// the projection down to the reader, and returns a ParquetIterator.
///
/// ParquetIterator implements the Iterator trait, yielding one RecordBatch per call to next()
/// It holds the resolved schema and the ParquetRecordBatchReader which tracks state internally.
/// next() delegates to the underlying reader, uses the schema resolved in scan() rather than
/// rebuilding it each time, converts the batch columns to ArrowFieldVectors, and packages everything into a RecordBatch.
/// When the file is exhausted, next() returns None.
///
/// ParquetDataSource implements the DataSource trait for reading Parquet files.
/// Unlike CsvDataSource, we don't need an optional schema or a has_headers flag
/// because Parquet files are self-describing - the schema is always embedded
/// in the file footer and is read automatically by the parquet crate.
